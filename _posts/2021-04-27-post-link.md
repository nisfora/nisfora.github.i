Contributing to open-source projects not only adds value to the project but also drives the entire community forward. Besides we all want to build a nice GitHub profile and earn those shiny contribution badges to showcase on profile.

Let’s take an example that I want to contribute to the following Repository: [https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs)

## **Step 1 — Fork the target repository to contribute**

This will fork the target repository to your own GitHub. From here on I will call this repo as “your forked repo”.

**Target Repo:** [https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs)
**Forked Repo:** [https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs](https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git)

## Step 2 — Clone the forked repository

Example: `git clone [https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git`](https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git)

Note: Remember this is the forked repository and not the target repository

## Step 3 — Adding upstream remote

* Change the directory to the forked repository: `cd awesome-rl-envs`

* Add the target repository as upstream remote:
`git remote add upstream [https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs.git`](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs.git)

* Use `git remote -v` to verify the changes. It should look like this:

```
origin [https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git](https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git) (fetch)
origin [https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git](https://github.com/nitesh4146/awesome-rl-envs.git) (push)
upstream [https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs.git](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs.git) (fetch)
upstream [https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs.git](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs.git) (push)
```


## Step 4 — Keep your cloned repository Up-to-date

Make sure that your cloned repository is updated to latest changes in the target repository. To do this pull the upstream remote using :
`git pull upstream master`

## Step 5 —Make your awesome contributions

Make changed to your local repository files as needed for meaningful contributions

## Step 6 —Add, Commit and Push the changes

* Stage your changes with following command: `git add -A`

* Commit the changes: `git commit -m "DESCRIPTION MESSAGE"`

* Push to branch (master in this case)— `git push origin master`

## Step 7 — Create Pull Request

Reload your forked repository and you should see an option to create a pull request. Verify your changes and add a brief description of your contribution(s).
